## 17th Feb 2022

Today, after spending yet another hour in a meeting where I contributed nothing, in a job I'm conflicted about, I have decided I'm going to take back control of my life.

```
For too long I have been a slave to my short term materialistic desires. 
Its time I break my chains and become a slave to my long term materialistic desires.
```

Anyway,I have decided its time for me to leave the country in the next couple years. 
There is nothing left for me here except my job, my loving family, and my friends, whom I consider family.

This is the end.
