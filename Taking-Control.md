## 17th Feb 2022

Today, after spending yet another hour in a meeting where I contributed nothing, in a job I'm conflicted about, I have decided I'm going to take back control of my life.

```
For too long I have been a slave to my short term materialistic desires. 
Its time I break my chains and become a slave to my long term materialistic desires.
```

Anyway,I have decided its time for me to leave the country in the next couple years. 
There is nothing left for me here except my job, my loving family, and my friends, whom I consider family.

This is the end.


## 6th March 2022

Its been 2 weeks since I decided I will be leaving the company for good.

In these past 2 weeks I have given 2 interviews and absolutely bombed them both.
Also got a minor surgery and am too broke to buy myself something nice. Russia has invaded Ukraine and people are dying. I wish for the violence to end soon.

but in the midst of all the bad news 
- I have found a way to take on extra work at work.
- Kaamchore's backend is live.
- I met Nush and she really liked her birthday gift.
- Spent an entire day with Ritika.

I have also shortlisted my list of colleges I'll apply to.
It also looks like I need to start skilling up again.

Things are not looking up yet but hopefully they will soon.
