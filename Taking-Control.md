## 17th Feb 2022

Today, after spending yet another hour in a meeting where I contributed nothing, in a job I'm conflicted about, I have decided I'm going to take back control of my life.

```
For too long I have been a slave to my short term materialistic desires. 
Its time I break my chains and become a slave to my long term materialistic desires.
```

Anyway,I have decided its time for me to leave the country in the next couple years. 
There is nothing left for me here except my job, my loving family, and my friends, whom I consider family.

This is the end.


## 6th March 2022

Its been 2 weeks since I decided I will be leaving the company for good.

In these past 2 weeks I have given 2 interviews and absolutely bombed them both.
Also got a minor surgery and am too broke to buy myself something nice. Russia has invaded Ukraine and people are dying. I wish for the violence to end soon :(.

but in the midst of all the bad news 
- I have found a way to take on extra work at work.
- Kaamchore's backend is live.
- I met Nush and she really liked her birthday gift.
- Spent an entire day with R.

I have also shortlisted my list of colleges I'll apply to.
It also looks like I need to start skilling up again.

Things are not looking up yet but hopefully they will soon.

I'm changing jobs. As of 4th April 2022 I'll be joining Moveworks. Everyone close to me doubts this descision. While it is normal for my dad question my sanity, I'm doubtful of the change myself.
Is it the right move? Am I getting scammed? What kinda resignation letter do I write?
"Hi, I don't like how little work I do here so toodles."??

Seems like Russia made a few logistical mistakes in Ukraine, the war is still going on. But my country made an international transaction that was not in dollars, which is good news I guess. I don't understand the economics of it, but just proud of what it symbolizes. 

Anyway seems like my plan to leave the country is going to be postponed.

Admist the confusion I met up with a friend. It was fun.
A lot of my friends are coming back to bangalore so next month is going to be fun too.

Still waiting for things to look up.

## 25th June 2022

Its been a while since my last entry. Work has been amazing.
My parents be asking me if I want to go for higher studies or not like I'm supposed to ansewer to that yet.

Learnt a little bit about writing a controller. Recently realised how bad I am at LLD.
But its okay, now that I know I can work on it.

Learnt a new song and got good reviews on it.

tldr: Life is like fine wine right now. Its super kadwa and you need to develop a taste for it. but once you do, you become an at risk alcoholic but its also fun.


## 29th Jan 2022

Writing again after a long hiatus. January 2023 came like a thunderstorm leaving destruction in its wake. Still better than January 2019 I would wager. Now that I think about it, most major tragedies in my life occur in this month. 
 
[1]"I now declare, I will die in Janurary. I do not know which year at this point of time but a certain Januray cometh and I goeth"

I have now started a diet and impulse bought a watch which tells me to walk every 40 mins (THE AUDACITY). Will try to reach 15% body fat soon. Work has been relentless but the long weekend was a godsend. Slowly making progress in Piano. I also started a Piano account xD. Do not ask me the handle I will not be disclosing that piece of information right now. I want it to grow organically and I already have 3 organic followers which is already amazing to me.

[1]: It came to me while thinking thoughts.
